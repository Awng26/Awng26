I have coded before with JavaScript, HTML, C, a bit in C++, Python, although I'm not too great in any. I've done CS50, and also have coded with a friend before as well. <br>
The reason I took this class is because I am interested in Computer Science, and would like to learn more about it, as well as possibly continue a future into CS.  <br>
Some of my current interests/hobbies include: <br>
  * Video Games
  * Blender
  * Coding (A little)
  * Tennis
  * Robotics
  * Piano <br>

Some goals I have for this class include learning more about Computer Science, and just getting better at recognizing and writing code.
